# Data Science Specialization

Here are some of my programming assignments for the Data Science Specialization MOOC on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science), taught by the Johns Hopkins University, from November 2015 to January 2016  

This Specialization covers the concepts and tools you'll need throughout the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results. In the final Capstone Project, youâ€™ll apply the skills learned by building a data product using real-world data. At completion, students will have a portfolio demonstrating their mastery of the material.  

####The courses in the specialization are:
1. The Data Scientist's Toolbox
2. R programming
3. Getting and Cleaning Data
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Reproducible Research
6. Statistical Inference
7. Regression Models
8. Practical Machine Learning
9. Developing Data Products 

I did not save all the scripts at the time I took the courses, you will only find a small portion of the exercises in these folders.
